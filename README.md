This is the core repository for the Vega System. Currently this project is a work in progress.
In order to interact with the contracts you must either deploy them or import add into another project as a dependency.

The contracts provided should allow an individual to run a token creation event for the Vega Token, and then provides basic proposal structure.

The system is designed such that any contract address can be supplied for any proposal during creation. This means choices are not limited to the options provided here.
