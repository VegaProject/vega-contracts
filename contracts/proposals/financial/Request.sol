/**@title Request Proposal 
* Request proposals are used to allow other contracts or accounts hire Vega. Tokens used in a request
* proposal give Vega the right to all of their features defined by their contract, however, Vega cannot
* spend them through an Allocation proposal. You can think of these proposals as almost the reverse of an
* Allocation proposal. They give Vega the right to manage tokens on behalf of another entity, in exchange
* for some kind of contract.
